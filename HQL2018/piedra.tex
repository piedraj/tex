\section{FCNC in ${\rm tZq \to 3\ell}$}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the standard model (SM), FCNC are
forbidden at tree level and highly suppressed at higher orders. Several
extensions of the SM enhance the FCNC branching fractions and can be probed at
the LHC; the new couplings can also provide for flavour changing single top
quark production in association with a Z or a Higgs boson.
This analysis~\cite{top-17-017} uses proton-proton collision data coming from the
2016 data taking period, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
${\rm 35.9~fb^{-1}}$ at a centre-of-mass energy of 13~TeV collected by the CMS
detector~\cite{cms-detector}. The analysis focuses on the experimental search for evidence of a FCNC
vertex (referred to as tZq) with a top quark, a Z boson, and a quark q that is
either up or charm. In the final state we expect one jet originating from a b quark,
a W boson, a Z boson, and (in the case of FCNC top quark decay) a jet originating
from the up or charm quark. As we limit the analysis to leptonic decays of both the
W and the Z boson, events are selected requiring exactly 3 leptons containing one
opposite sign, same flavour pair; at least 1 jet and at most 3 jets; and the
transverse mass of the W boson below 300~GeV. Four different lepton channels are
considered (3e, 2e1$\mu$, 1e2$\mu$, 3$\mu$) and two signal regions, the single top
quark FCNC (STSR) and the top quark pair FCNC (TTSR), are constructed, using the
jet multiplicity. A simultaneous global fit is performed taking into account
both signal regions and background regions, for the four lepton channels with the
help of boosted decision trees (BDT), used to discriminate between signal and
background. The resulting discriminating output variables from each BDT are
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:TOP-17-017_Figure_003}. The signal strength and significance
are computed treating all systematic uncertainties as nuisance parameters and are
constrained from the fit, which uses templates in the different signal and
background regions for each of the four different lepton channels. The resulting
observed (expected) limits where both couplings are non-vanishing are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:TOP-17-017_Figure_007}. No significant deviation is observed from
the predicted background. Observed (expected) upper limits at 95\% CL are set on
the branching fractions of top quark decays:
${\cal B}({\rm t \to uZ}) < 0.024\%~(0.015\%)$ and
${\cal B}({\rm t \to cZ}) < 0.045\%~(0.037\%)$, assuming one non-vanishing
coupling at a time.

\section{FCNC in ${\rm tH \to bb}$}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this analysis~\cite{top-17-003} we also search for FCNC in events with the
top quark and the Higgs boson, but considering the Higgs boson decays to b
quarks. The tH FCNC interaction is studied in two channels: the associated
production of a single top quark with the Higgs boson (ST), and the FCNC decays
of top quarks in ${\rm t{\bar t}}$ semileptonic events (TT). As before, the data
sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of~${\rm 35.9~fb^{-1}}$. Events
with exactly one isolated lepton (electron or muon) are selected, and at least
3 jets are required to be present. As signal events contain three b quarks,
we require that at least two jets are identified as b quark jets by the combined
secondary vertex (CSV) b-tagging algorithm. In order to optimize the sensitivity
to the signal event selection, events are split into five categories based on
the total number of reconstructed jets and on the number of b-tagged jets.
Using the energy and momenta of all particles, a full kinematic reconstruction
of the event is performed for several signal (ST and TT) and background
(${\rm t{\bar t}}$) hypotheses. The reconstruction is performed for all possible
permutations of the b-tagged jets to be associated with the decay products of
the Higgs boson or the top quark. The reconstructed kinematic variables for each
permutation are then fed  into a multivariate analysis that uses a BDT, trained
to distinguish the correct from the wrong b jet assignments. In addition,
kinematic variables from the event reconstruction are used to construct several
BDTs to suppress backgrounds. The BDTs are trained for each jet multiplicity
category to identify signal events that are generated either for
${\rm \kappa_{Hut}}$ (Hut) or ${\rm \kappa_{Hct}}$ (Hct) coupling against the
sum of all background events. Separate trainings of the BDT for Hut and Hct are
done. Distributions for some of the most discriminating BDT input variables,
in the category with three jets, all of them b-tagged, can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:TOP-17-003_Figure_002}. The final observable used to extract
signal events is defined as the BDT score distribution. The resultant observed
(expected) 95\% CL exclusion limits on top quark FCNC decay branching fractions
are ${\cal B}({\rm t \to uH}) < 0.47\%~(0.34\%)$ and
${\cal B}({\rm t \to cH}) < 0.47\%~(0.44\%)$. Two-dimensional limits are also
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:TOP-17-003_Figures_006-007}. We define a signal strength
parameter $\mu = \sigma/\sigma_{\rm sig}$, where $\sigma$ is the cross section
excluded at 95\% CL and $\sigma_{\rm sig}$ is the predicted cross section for
signal. A maximum likelihood fit is performed for the signal strength, and is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:TOP-17-003_Figures_006-007}.

\section{Angular observables in ${\rm B^+ \to K^+\mu^+\mu^-}$}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In~\cite{bph-15-001} we present a study of the angular distribution of the FCNC
decay ${\rm B^+ \to K^+\mu^+\mu^-}$ in pp collisions at the center-of-mass
energy of 8~TeV. The analysis is based on data collected by the CMS detector at
the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of ${\rm 20.5~fb^{-1}}$.
There are two model-independent parameters that describe the decay rate for the
process: the forward/backward asymmetry $A_{FB}$ of the dimuon system and the
contribution $F_H$ from the pseudo-scalar, scalar, and tensor amplitudes to the
decay width. Because SM amplitudes may interefere with the contributions from
non-SM particles inside loop diagrams, the transition can probe the presence of
yet unobserved particles and processes.
The decay rate for the process ${\rm B^+ \to K^+\mu^+\mu^-}$ depends on
$\cos\theta_{\ell}$, where $\theta_{\ell}$ is the angle between the direction
of the $\mu^-$ and the ${\rm K^+}$ in the dilepton rest frame. The
$\cos\theta_{\ell}$-dependence of the decay process can be parametrized in
terms of the observables of interest $A_{FB}$ and $F_H$, which are extracted
with an extended unbinned maximum-likelihood fit to the angular distributions
of the selected B candidates in the data, in bins of $q^2$.
Figure~\ref{fig:BPH-15-001_Figures_003-004} show the projections from the
two-dimensional fits for the inclusive low-$q^2$ range ${\rm 1-6~GeV^2}$.
The measured values of $A_{FB}$ and $F_H$ for each $q^2$ bin are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:BPH-15-001_Figure_005__BPH-15-008_Figure003}
(top distributions). The results are consistent with previous measurements and
with various standard model predictions.

\section{Angular observables in ${\rm B^0 \to K^{*0}\mu^+\mu^-}$}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In~\cite{bph-15-008} we study angular distributions of the decay
${\rm B^0 \to K^{*0}\mu^+\mu^-}$ using a sample of proton-proton at the
center-of-mass energy of 8~TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC,
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of ${\rm 20.5~fb^{-1}}$. An
angular analysis is performed to determine the $P_1$ and $P'_5$ paramters,
where the $P'_5$ parameter is of particular interest because of recent
measurements that indicate a potential discrepancy with the standard model
predictions. Based on a sample of 1397 signal events, the $P_1$ and
$P'_5$ parameters are determined as a function of the dimuon invariant mass
squared, as can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:BPH-15-001_Figure_005__BPH-15-008_Figure003}
(bottom distributions). The measurements are in agreement with predictions
based on the standard model.
