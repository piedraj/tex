\section{Introduction}
%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The discovery of the Higgs boson was announced in 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS
collaborations~\cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012ufa} based on proton-proton
collisions collected at the CERN LHC at the centre of mass energies of 7 and
8~TeV. Since then a huge effort has been made in the determination of the
properties of this newly found particle. The dataset already collected at 13~TeV
allows inclusive Higgs boson measurements to be repeated. Furthermore, the
increased centre-of-mass energy results in much larger cross sections for events
at high partonic centre-of-mass energy. This implies improved sensitivity to a
variety of interesting physics processes, such as Higgs bosons produced at high
transverse momentum.

In this document we present the latest ATLAS and CMS measurements of several
Higgs properties in different decay channels, such as ${\rm H\to ZZ}$,
${\rm H\to\gamma\gamma}$ and ${\rm H\to\tau\tau}$. In addition, we also present
results on searches for phenomena beyond the Standard Model, in Higgs decays
to $\gamma\gamma$ or ${\rm b\bar{b}}$, with $E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}$ in the final
state.


%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\section{\boldmath ${\rm H}\to{\rm ZZ}$}
%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ${\rm H\to ZZ\to 4\ell}$ decay channel (${\rm \ell = e,\mu}$) has a large
signal-to-background ratio due to the complete reconstruction of the final state
decay products and excellent lepton momentum resolution, making it one of the
most important channels for studies of the Higgs boson's properties. Here we
present measurements of properties of the Higgs boson in this channel at 13~TeV,
for both the ATLAS and CMS collaborations~\cite{ATLAS-ZZ,CMS:2017jkd}.

% CMS
In~\cite{CMS:2017jkd} the full kinematic information from each event using either
the Higgs boson decay products or associated particles in its production is
extracted using matrix element calculations and used to form several kinematic
discriminants. Both H boson decay kinematics and kinematics of associated
production of H+jet, H+2 jets, VBF, ZH and WH are explored. In order to improve
the sensitivity to the Higgs boson production mechanisms, the selected events
are classified into mutually exclusive categories, based on jet multiplicity,
b-tagged jets, the existence of additional leptons and the aforementioned
kinematic discriminants. The reconstructed four-lepton invariant mass distribution
is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:figure-ZZ} (Bottom left) for the sum of the 4e,
4$\mu$ and 2e2$\mu$ subchannels. To extract the signal strength for the excess
of events observed in the Higgs boson peak region an multi-dimensional fit
is performed, on the four-lepton invariant mass and one of the kinematic
discriminants. The fit is performed for several signal-strength modifiers
controlling the contribution of the main SM Higgs boson production modes: ggH,
VBF, WH, ZH and ${\rm t{\bar t}H}$, getting for all of them values consistent
with the SM expectaction, as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:figure-ZZ-2} (Center).
The inclusive observed (expected) signal-strength
modifiers is ${\rm 1.05_{-0.14}^{+0.15}(stat.)_{-0.09}^{+0.11}(syst.)}$
(${\rm 1.00_{-0.14}^{+0.15}(stat.)_{-0.09}^{+0.10}(syst.)}$).
Two signal-strength modifiers ${\rm \mu_{ggH,ttH}}$ and ${\rm \mu_{VBF,VH}}$ are
introduced as scale factors for the fermion and vector-boson induced contribution
to the expected SM cross section. A two-dimensional fit is performed assuming a
mass of ${\rm m_H = 125.09~GeV}$ leading to the measurements of
${\rm \mu_{ggH,ttH} = 1.20_{-0.31}^{+0.35}}$ and
${\rm \mu_{VBF,VH} = 0.00_{-0.00}^{+1.37}}$. The 68\% and 95\% CL contours are
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:figure-ZZ-2} (Left). We have also
measured the cross section for the production and decay ${\rm pp \to H \to 4\ell}$
within a fiducial volume defined to match closely the reconstruction selection.
The integrated fiducial cross section is measured to be
${\rm \sigma_{fid.} 2.90_{-0.44}^{+0.48}(stat.)_{-0.22}^{+0.27}(syst.)~fb}$.
This can be compared to the SM expectation
${\rm 2.72 \pm 0.14~fb}$. The measured differential cross section results for
${\rm p_{T}(H)}$ and ${\rm N_{jets}}$ can also be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:figure-ZZ}
(Bottom center and Bottom right). The dominant sources of systematic uncertainty are
the experimental uncertainties in the lepton identification efficiencies and
luminosity measurement. In order to improve the four-lepton invariant mass
resolution a 3D kinematic fit is performed using a mass constraint on the
intermediate Z resonance. The simultaneous fit on the four-lepton
invariant mass, the mass resolution and one of the kinematic discriminants
gives ${\rm m_{H} = 125.26 \pm 0.20(stat.) \pm 0.08(syst.)}~GeV$. The Higgs
width is also measured in the range ${rm 105 < m_{4\ell} < 140~GeV}$. No
assumptions need to be made about the presence of BSM particles or interactions
which could affect the Higgs boson couplings either in production or in decay.
We obtain a width that is constrained to be ${\rm \Gamma_{H} < 1.10~GeV}$ at
95\% CL.

% ATLAS
The ATLAS~\cite{ATLAS-ZZ} four-lepton invariant mass can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:figure-ZZ} (Top left). Similarly to the CMS analysis, fiducial
cross sections are defined at particle-level, with a selection chosen
to closely match the detector-level analysis. The inclusive fiducial cross
sections of Higgs-boson production at 13 TeV measured using
${\rm H \to ZZ \to 4\ell}$ decays are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:figure-ZZ-2}
(Right). The fiducial cross section is measured
to be ${\rm 3.62_{-0.50}^{+0.53}(stat.)_{-0.20}^{+0.25}(syst.)~fb}$, in agreement
with the SM prediction of ${\rm 2.91 \pm 0.13~fb}$. The measured total cross section is
${\rm 69_{-9}^{+10}(stat.)_{-4}^{+5}(syst.)}~pb$, to be compared with the
SM prediction of ${\rm 55.6 \pm 2.5~pb}$. The measured differential cross sections
for ${\rm p_T(H)}$ and ${\rm N_{jets}}$, together with their comparisons to SM
predictions, are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:figure-ZZ} (Top center and Top right).

\section{\boldmath ${\rm H}\to\tau\tau$}
%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To establish the mass generation mechanism for fermions, it is necessary to
demonstrate the direct coupling of the scalar boson to fermions, and the
proportionality of its strength to the fermion mass. The most promising decay
channel is $\tau\tau$, because of the large event rate expected in the SM
compared to the other leptonic decay modes, and of the smaller contribution
from background events with respect to the ${\rm b\bar{b}}$ channel. Here we
report the results of a search for the SM scalar boson using $35.9~{\rm fb^{-1}}$
at 13 TeV, when it decays to a pair of $\tau$ leptons~\cite{CMS:2017wyg}. The
four $\tau$-pair final states with the largest branching fractions,
$\mu\tau_{\rm h}$, ${\rm e}\tau_{\rm h}$, $\tau_{\rm h}\tau_{\rm h}$, and
${\rm e}\mu$, are studied.

The search for an excess of SM scalar boson events over the expected background
involves a global maximum likelihood fit based on two-dimensional distributions
in all channels, together with control regions for the ${\rm t{\bar t}}$, QCD
multijet and W+jets backgrounds. Figure~\ref{fig:tauhtauh_VBF} shows the
distribution observed, together with the expected background and signal
distributions, in the $\tau_{\rm h}\tau_{\rm h}$ channel and VBF category. The
signal prediction for a scalar boson with $m_{\rm H} = 125$~GeV is
normalized to its best-fit cross section times branching fraction. The background
distributions are adjusted to the results of the global maximum likelihood fit.

\section{Searches for new phenomena}
%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many searches for dark matter (DM) at the LHC involve missing transverse momentum
produced in association to detectable particles. Here we present an updated search
by the ATLAS experiment~\cite{ATLAS-twophoton-BSM} for DM associated with the SM
Higgs boson decaying to a pair of photons using $36.1~{\rm fb^{-1}}$ of pp
collision data collected at 13~TeV. Three theoretical benchmark models are
considered in this analysis. In the ${\rm Z_{B}'}$ model a massive vector
mediator ${\rm Z'}$ emits a Higgs boson and subsequently decays to a pair of Dirac
fermionic DM candidates.
%In scenarios where the DM couples to the SM only via the ${\rm Z'}$ boson, the
%associated $U'(1)$ symmetry ensures the stability of the DM particle.
The ${\rm Z'}$-${\rm 2HDM}$ model involves the ${\rm Z'}$ boson decaying
to the Higgs boson and an intermediate heavy pseudoscalar boson ${\rm A^{0}}$,
which then decays to a pair of Dirac fermionic DM particles. The third model,
referred to as the heavy scalar model, introduces a heavy scalar boson H
produced primarily via gluon-gluon fusion. Here an effective quartic coupling
between the SM Higgs h, H and two DM particles is considered, with the DM
particle assumed to be scalar. The events that pass a common selection requiring
at least two photon candidates are divided into five categories based on the
event kinematics. These categories have been optimized based either on the ${\rm Z_{B}'}$
and ${\rm Z'}$-${\rm 2HDM}$ signal samples, or using simulated heavy scalar
boson samples, to cover the different kinematic regimes of the heavy scalar
model. The results of the analysis are derived from a likelihood fit of the
$m_{\gamma\gamma}$ distribution in the range of
$105~{\rm GeV} < m_{\gamma\gamma} < 160~{\rm GeV}$.
%The systematic uncertainties worsen the limits by about 10\% (7\% from the
%non-resonant background modelling and 3\% from the other systematic uncertainties).
No significant excess over
the background expectation is observed and 95\% confidence level limits are set
on the production cross section times branching fraction of the SM Higgs boson
decaying into two photons in association with missing transverse energy in the
three different theoretical benchmark models. 95\% confidence level limits are
also set on the observed signal strength in a two-dimensional
$m_{\chi}$-$m_{\rm Z_{B}'}$ plane for the ${\rm Z_{B}'}$ model, and the
$m_{\rm A^0}$-$m_{\rm Z'}$ plane for the ${\rm Z'}$-${\rm 2HDM}$ model. In the
model involving heavy scalar production, 95\% confidence level upper limits are
set on the production cross section times the branching fraction of
${\rm H}\to{\rm h}\chi\chi$, for a dark matter
particle with mass of 60 GeV. The heavy scalar model is excluded for all the
benchmark points investigated.

Another search for DM has been carried out in~\cite{ATLAS-bb-BSM}. In this case
DM is searched for in association with a SM-like Higgs boson decaying to a pair
of b-quarks, using $36.1~{\rm fb^{-1}}$ of pp collisions at 13 TeV recorded with
the ATLAS detector. The ${\rm Z'}$-${\rm 2HDM}$ model has been used for the
optimization of the search and its interpretation. Multivariate algorithms are
used to identify jets containing b-hadrons that are expected in
${\rm h}\to{\rm b{\bar b}}$ decays.
